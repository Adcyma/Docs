# Departments

The Departments page provides a centralized interface for managing your organization's department structure. This master list of departments serves as the foundation for user assignments and workflow configurations throughout the system.

## Managing Your Department List

From this page, you can:
- View all departments currently configured in your system
- Add new departments to reflect organizational changes or growth
- Remove departments that are no longer needed
- Maintain an accurate department structure for your organization

## How Departments Are Used

Departments play a key role throughout the platform:
- **User Assignment:** Assign users to specific departments for organizational tracking
- **Workflow Integration:** Utilize departments in workflow rules and routing logic
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Filter and organize data by department
- **Access Control:** Department-based permissions and visibility settings

## Saving Changes

**Important:** After making any modifications to your department list—whether adding new departments or removing existing ones—you must click the **Save Changes** button to commit your updates. Changes are not automatically saved and will be lost if you navigate away without saving.

## Best Practices

When managing departments:
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Consider how department changes might affect existing user assignments
- Review workflow configurations that reference specific departments
- Coordinate department changes with your team to avoid disruptions

## Initial Synchronization

Your department data is initially imported from Entra ID during setup. Please note:
- This is a one-time import, not an ongoing synchronization
- Departments are fetched from Entra ID when first configured
- After the initial import, you can manually add or remove departments as needed
- Future changes in Entra ID will not automatically update this list
