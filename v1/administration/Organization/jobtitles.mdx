The Job Titles page provides a centralized interface for managing your organization's job title structure. This master list of job titles serves as the foundation for user assignments and workflow configurations throughout the system.

## Managing Your Job Title List

From this page, you can:
- View all job titles currently configured in your system
- Add new job titles to reflect organizational changes or new roles
- Remove job titles that are no longer needed
- Maintain an accurate job title structure for your organization

## How Job Titles Are Used

Job titles play a key role throughout the platform:
- **User Assignment:** Assign specific job titles to users for role identification
- **Workflow Integration:** Utilize job titles in workflow rules and routing logic
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Filter and organize data by job title
- **Access Control:** Job title-based permissions and visibility settings
- **Organizational Hierarchy:** Define role relationships and reporting structures

## Saving Changes

**Important:** After making any modifications to your job title list—whether adding new titles or removing existing ones—you must click the **Save Changes** button to commit your updates. Changes are not automatically saved and will be lost if you navigate away without saving.

## Best Practices

When managing job titles:
- Use standardized, professional naming conventions
- Consider how job title changes might affect existing user assignments
- Review workflow configurations that reference specific job titles
- Align job titles with your organization's formal role structure
- Coordinate job title changes with HR and management teams

## Initial Synchronization

Your job title data is initially imported from Entra ID during setup. Please note:
- This is a one-time import, not an ongoing synchronization
- Job titles are fetched from Entra ID when first configured
- After the initial import, you can manually add or remove job titles as needed
- Future changes in Entra ID will not automatically update this list
