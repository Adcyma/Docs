# Managed Users

The Managed Users page displays all the users that are managed by Adcyma. Administrators can view details such as display names, usernames, job titles, and departments for each managed user.

This is also where you select the Entra ID group that determines which users Adcyma will manage. Use the dropdown to pick the desired group and click Save Group to apply your selection.
