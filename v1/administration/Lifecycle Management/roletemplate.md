# Role Templates

The Role Templates page lets administrators create Roles that can be assigned to users through Workflows. These Roles help automate access management by allowing Workflows to grant the right groups at the right time for the right users.

*Role Templates help automate access assignment but do not immediately provision access until applied within a [Workflow](https://docs.adcyma.com/v1/workflows).*

Administrators can:

* **Create Roles:** Define roles and their associated access permissions, making them available for use in Workflows.
* **Edit Roles:** Modify existing roles.
* **Delete Roles:** Remove roles that are no longer needed.

<h2>Example Use Case</h2>

A **"New Employee - IT Department"** role template might include:

* Access to corporate email
* Membership in the IT support group
* Permissions for internal tools like the ticketing system

By incorporating **Roles** into workflows, administrators can ensure consistent, efficient, and rule-based access provisioning without manual intervention.
