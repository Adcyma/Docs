# System Users

The System Users page provides comprehensive management of internal Adcyma user accounts. These are administrative accounts that grant access to the Adcyma platform itself, separate from the managed users in your tenant. This interface allows administrators to control who can access Adcyma and what level of permissions they have within the system.

:::info Important Distinction
System users are internal Adcyma accounts and **are not automatically provisioned to your tenant**. These accounts provide access to the Adcyma platform only and are separate from your organization's managed user population.

Permanently remove user accounts when team members no longer require access to the Adcyma platform.
