# Logs

The Logs page gives you a behind-the-scenes look at what’s happening across your identity setup in Adcyma. It's where you can keep track of key events, actions, and any issues that might pop up.

Here’s a few of the things you’ll see in the logs:

- New user created

- User details updated

- New workflow or dynamic group created

- Successful logins and failed login attempts

- Errors — if something didn’t go as planned

You can use filters to find specific type of events, users, or time periods — helpful when you're trying to figure out what happened, or just checking that everything’s working as expected.

It helps you spot what changed, when it changed, and who did it.
