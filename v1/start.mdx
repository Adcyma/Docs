## Key Terminology

Understanding these core concepts will help you navigate Adcyma effectively:

### **Workflows**
The heart of Adcyma's automation capabilities. A [Workflow](https://docs.adcyma.com/v1/workflows) is a configurable sequence of logic that automates identity management processes. Every workflow consists of three essential components:

- **Trigger**: The event that initiates the workflow (e.g., new hire in HR system, role change, termination)
- **Condition**: The business logic that determines when actions should be taken (e.g., department = "Sales", location = "Stockholm") 
- **Action**: The specific tasks performed when conditions are met (e.g., add to Entra ID groups, assign licenses, send notifications)

*Example*: A new employee workflow might trigger when someone joins the Sales department, check their location and role, then automatically add them to the appropriate Entra ID groups for sales tools, regional resources, and company-wide access.

### **Access Profiles**
Access Profiles simplify complex permission management by bundling related **Entra ID groups** into logical units. Instead of manually assigning multiple individual group memberships, Access Profiles allow you to grant comprehensive access with a single assignment through Workflows.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Simplified Management**: Bundle related permissions under meaningful names
- **Consistent Access**: Ensure users receive all necessary group memberships together
- **Workflow Integration**: Automatically assign comprehensive access based on business rules
- **Reduced Errors**: Eliminate forgotten permissions through standardized profiles

*Example*: A "Finance Team Access" profile might include Entra ID groups for:
- Financial reporting tools
- Expense management systems
- Department-specific SharePoint sites
- Budget planning applications
- Compliance and audit resources

When a new finance employee is hired, a single workflow action assigns the entire Access Profile, ensuring they receive all necessary permissions without manual intervention.
