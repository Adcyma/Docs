# Authentication

Adcyma provides enterprise-grade authentication through two secure methods: Magic Links (default) and Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (recommended). Traditional password-based authentication is not supported to ensure maximum security and reduce attack vectors.

## Overview

Our authentication system prioritizes security and user experience by eliminating password-related vulnerabilities:

- **Magic Links** - Default passwordless authentication via email verification
- **Microsoft Entra ID SSO** - Recommended authentication method for enhanced security

## Security Philosophy

> **Zero-Password Security**
> 
> Adcyma does not store or manage user passwords. This eliminates risks associated with password breaches, weak passwords, and credential stuffing attacks.

**Why we chose these methods:**
- **Eliminates password vulnerabilities** - No passwords to crack, steal, or compromise
- **Reduces attack surface** - Fewer authentication vectors to secure
- **Improves user experience** - No passwords to remember or reset
- **Flexible deployment** - Start simple, upgrade when ready
- **Multi-factor capable** - Both methods support additional security layers

## Magic Links (Default Authentication)

### Overview

Magic Links are the default authentication method for Adcyma, providing secure, passwordless access by sending time-limited authentication links directly to verified email addresses.

### How Magic Links Work

1. **User initiates login** with their email address
2. **System generates secure token** with expiration time
3. **Email sent** containing unique authentication link
4. **User clicks link** to complete authentication
5. **Automatic login** with session establishment

### Security Features

- **Time-limited tokens** - Links expire after 15 minutes
- **Single-use authentication** - Each link can only be used once
- **Email verification** - Confirms user controls the email address
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents abuse (5 requests per hour per email)
- **Secure token generation** - Cryptographically secure random tokens
- **Session management** - Configurable session duration with automatic extension

### User Experience

1. User enters email address on login page
2. System sends magic link to verified email address
3. User checks email and clicks authentication link
4. Automatic redirect to Adcyma with active session
5. Session persists based on configured duration

### When Magic Links Are Available

Magic Links are available when:
- **SSO is disabled** (default state)
- **Administrator has turned off SSO** 
- **Organization chooses to use email-based authentication**

## Microsoft Entra ID SSO (Recommended)

### Overview

Microsoft Entra ID SSO provides enhanced authentication by integrating with your Microsoft identity infrastructure. This is the recommended authentication method for all organizations seeking improved security and user experience.

> **Recommended for All Organizations**
> 
> SSO with Microsoft Entra ID provides superior security, better user experience, and centralized access management compared to Magic Links.

### How SSO Works

1. User accesses Adcyma application
2. System redirects to your Microsoft Entra ID tenant
3. User authenticates with corporate Microsoft credentials
4. Entra ID redirects back to Adcyma with authentication token
5. User gains access to Adcyma with appropriate permissions

### Benefits of SSO

**Security Advantages:**
- Leverages Microsoft's enterprise security infrastructure
- Inherits your existing multi-factor authentication policies
- Centralized user management and access control
- Comprehensive audit trails through Microsoft security logging
- Eliminates email-based authentication vectors
- Advanced conditional access policies

**User Experience:**
- Single sign-on across Microsoft ecosystem
- No additional credentials to manage
- Familiar Microsoft authentication interface
- Automatic session management
- Faster authentication process
- No need to check email for access

**Administrative Benefits:**
- Centralized user provisioning and deprovisioning
- Group-based access control from Entra ID
- Integration with existing Microsoft security policies
- Simplified user lifecycle management
- Real-time access control changes

### SSO Administration

**Enabling SSO:**
- Administrators can enable SSO through Adcyma settings
- Requires Microsoft Entra ID configuration
- Magic Links automatically disabled when SSO is active

**Disabling SSO:**
- Administrators can turn off SSO at any time
- Magic Links become available again immediately
- Users can choose their preferred authentication method

> **Flexible Configuration**
> 
> Administrators have full control over authentication methods and can switch between Magic Links and SSO as organizational needs change.

## Authentication States

### SSO Enabled State

When SSO is enabled by administrators:
- **All users** authenticate through Microsoft Entra ID
- **Magic Links** are not available
- **Centralized access control** through Entra ID groups and policies
- **Enhanced security** through Microsoft's identity platform

### SSO Disabled State (Default)

When SSO is disabled (default state):
- **Magic Links** are the active authentication method
- **Email-based authentication** for all users
- **Flexible access** without Microsoft infrastructure requirements
- **Simple deployment** and user management

## Choosing Your Authentication Method

### Microsoft Entra ID SSO (Recommended)

**Benefits for any organization:**
- Enhanced security compared to email-based authentication
- Better user experience with single sign-on
- Centralized identity management
- Advanced security policies and monitoring
- Professional authentication experience

**Requirements:**
- Microsoft Entra ID tenant (Office 365 or standalone)
- User accounts in Entra ID
- Administrator access to configure integration

### Magic Links

**Suitable when:**
- Quick deployment needed without infrastructure setup
- Temporary or project-based access requirements
- Preference for email-based authentication

## Account Recovery and Access Issues

### If SSO Access Is Lost

When SSO is enabled and access issues occur:

1. **Contact your IT Administrator** first for Entra ID-related problems
2. **Contact Adcyma Support** if administrator cannot resolve
3. **Provide setup information** for company verification if needed
4. **Administrator can disable SSO** to restore Magic Link access temporarily

### If Magic Links Access Is Lost

When Magic Links are enabled and access issues occur:

1. **Check email delivery** and spam folders
2. **Verify email address** is correct and accessible
3. **Contact Adcyma Support** with setup information for verification
4. **Company verification process** using original registration details

### Setup Information for Verification

- Organization details from initial registration
- Administrative contact information
- Original configuration details
- Billing and subscription information

## Security Best Practices

### For Magic Links

- Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your domain
- Monitor for suspicious authentication patterns
- Educate users about prompt email checking

**User Guidelines:**
- Check email promptly after requesting authentication
- Don't share authentication links
