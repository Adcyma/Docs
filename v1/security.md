# Security

Security is fundamental to everything we build. Our comprehensive security approach protects your data through multiple layers of defense, industry best practices, and continuous monitoring.

## Application Security

### OWASP Top 10 Compliance
We actively work to follow and implement protections against the **OWASP Top 10** security risks, including:

- **Injection attacks** (SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
- **Broken authentication and session management**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**
- **Insecure direct object references**
- **Security misconfigurations**
- **Sensitive data exposure**
- **Missing function level access control**
- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)**
- **Using components with known vulnerabilities**
- **Unvalidated redirects and forwards**

### Secure Development Practices
- Regular security code reviews and static analysis
- Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Secure coding standards and training
- Dependency management and vulnerability tracking

## Infrastructure Security

### Multi-Layer Protection
Our infrastructure implements defense in depth with multiple security layers:

**Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- Protection against common web attacks and exploits
- Real-time threat detection and blocking
- Bot protection and rate limiting
- Custom rules for application-specific threats

**Network Security**
- Network isolation and segmentation
- Access controls and least privilege principles
- Regular security assessments and monitoring
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems

**Container Security**
- Secure container images and runtime protection
- Image vulnerability scanning
- Container isolation and resource limits
- Regular security updates and patching

## Data Protection

### Encryption
**Data at Rest**
- All stored data encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
- Secure key management and rotation
- Database-level encryption for sensitive information

**Data in Transit**
- TLS encryption for all data transmission
- Certificate management and validation
- Secure API communications
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive operations

### Data Residency & Privacy
- **EU Data Residency**: All data hosted within Sweden and remains in the EU
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full alignment with European privacy regulations
- **Data minimization**: We only collect and store necessary data
- **Right to deletion**: Complete data removal capabilities

## Access Controls

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and audits

### Administrative Security
- Secure administrative access procedures
- Audit logging for all administrative actions
- Separation of duties for critical operations
- Regular credential rotation and management

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Continuous Monitoring
- 24/7 security monitoring and alerting
- Automated threat detection and response
- Regular security metrics and reporting
- Performance and availability monitoring

### Incident Response
- Dedicated incident response procedures
- Rapid containment and remediation capabilities
- Post-incident analysis and improvement
- Communication protocols for security events

## Cloud Security

### AWS Security Benefits
Our AWS infrastructure provides enterprise-grade security features:
- **Shared responsibility model** with AWS handling infrastructure security
- **Compliance certifications** (SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, etc.)
- **Regular security updates** and managed services

### Expert Management
Our security posture is maintained by experienced cloud engineers with expertise in:
- Cloud security architecture and best practices
- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Security automation and orchestration
- Compliance and regulatory requirements

## Compliance & Standards

### Industry Standards
We align our security practices with recognized industry frameworks:
- **ISO 27001** security management principles
- **OWASP** secure development guidelines
- **NIST** cybersecurity framework
- **EU GDPR** privacy and data protection compliance

### Regular Assessments
- Periodic security audits and assessments
- Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Compliance reviews and gap analysis
- Third-party security validations

## Transparency & Communication

We believe in security through transparency:
- Regular security updates and communications
- Clear incident notification procedures
- Open dialogue about security practices
- Continuous improvement based on feedback
